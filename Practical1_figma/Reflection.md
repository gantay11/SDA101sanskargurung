Working with Figma has greatly enhanced my understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. Figma’s intuitive interface and collaborative features allowed me to create interactive prototypes, wireframes, and visual designs efficiently. While using Figma, I learned how to structure designs using frames, components, and layers, which improved my ability to maintain consistency across projects. The real-time collaboration feature made it easy to share designs with peers, receive feedback, and make instant adjustments, simulating a professional design workflow. I also explored tools like auto-layout, vector networks, and prototyping links, which deepened my knowledge of designing responsive interfaces. Working in Figma taught me the importance of user-centered design, attention to detail, and iterative development, as small adjustments in layout, spacing, and color can significantly affect usability and aesthetics. Overall, using Figma strengthened my design thinking skills, improved my visual communication, and prepared me to work on practical digital design projects.
