Reflection on My Student Profile Webpage Project

Creating the student profile webpage helped me better understand how HTML and CSS work together to build a complete webpage. While writing the structure using HTML, I learned how important it is to use proper tags, closing tags, and correct attribute names such as “href” instead of “herf.” Mistakes in structure can break the entire page, so this project made me more careful with my code formatting.

Styling the webpage using CSS also helped me understand how different selectors, such as class selectors, universal selectors, and element selectors, affect the appearance of content. I explored background colors, text formatting, alignment, and hover effects. This taught me how even small CSS issues, like repeating the universal selector or incorrect margin syntax, can change the layout unexpectedly.

Building a navigation bar was one of the most educational parts of the project because it required combining HTML structure (lists, links, buttons) with flexbox CSS properties to align items properly. It also helped me understand mobile responsiveness and the importance of using the correct HTML nesting.

Through this profile page, I gained confidence in designing simple webpages. It made me realize the importance of clean structure, readable code, and organized styling. This project has motivated me to keep improving my web development skills so I can build more advanced and responsive websites in the future.
