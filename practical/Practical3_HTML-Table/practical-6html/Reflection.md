Short Reflection on Portfolio Webpage

Creating my portfolio webpage helped me strengthen my understanding of layout techniques using both Flexbox and CSS Grid. By designing sections such as the navigation bar, skills cards, and project gallery, I learned how modern CSS can organize content neatly and responsively. Building this project also improved my ability to write clean HTML structure and divide components into reusable, meaningful sections. Overall, this portfolio enhanced my web-design confidence and allowed me to practice creating a visually balanced and professional webpage.
