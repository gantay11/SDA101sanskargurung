# DOM Practice Webpage

This project is a simple HTML page designed to practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript. The structure includes headings, paragraphs, a container section, and buttons that will later trigger dynamic changes on the webpage.

 A main title with an ID for easy DOM selection
 Multiple paragraphs with the same class to test query selection
 A container section containing additional text
 Three buttons for:

   Changing text
   Adding a new element
   Removing the last element

 Technologies Used

 for webpage structure
 (to be added) for DOM manipulation
 for minimal styling and layout

 How to Use

1. Save the file as `index.html`.
2. Add a `script.js` file for DOM functions.
3. Link the script file inside the HTML using a `<script>` tag.
4. Use JavaScript to target elements by ID, class, or tag name.
5. Implement functions to change text, add elements, or remove elements.

 Future Improvements

* Add actual JavaScript functionality for each button
* Improve styling with external CSS
* Add animations for added or removed elements

 Purpose

This webpage was created to practice the basics of DOM selection, event handling, and dynamic content manipulation.
