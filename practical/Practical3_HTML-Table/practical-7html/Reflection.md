Short Reflection on DOM Practice Webpage

Building this DOM Practice webpage helped me understand how HTML elements can be accessed and manipulated using the Document Object Model. By adding buttons such as “Change Text,” “Add New Element,” and “Remove Last Element,” I learned how important it is to structure HTML clearly so JavaScript can target specific IDs and classes. Creating sections like the container box and multiple paragraphs also made it easier to experiment with DOM methods such as query selectors and dynamic element creation. Overall, this activity improved my confidence in preparing a webpage for interactive JavaScript functionality.
