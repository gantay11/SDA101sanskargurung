Short Reflection on Registration Form Validation

Working on the Registration Form Validation project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive and user-friendly forms. By adding input fields for username, email, password, and confirm password, I learned the importance of using unique IDs and proper structure for accurate validation. Implementing error messages showed me how JavaScript can dynamically check input values and guide users to correct mistakes. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in form handling, validation logic, and building clean, functional user interfaces.
